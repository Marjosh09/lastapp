<div class="love"><p>You have always had great insight into other people, Aquarius. You can meet someone and understand them - understand their spirit and what makes them tick almost instantly. This makes you a good judge of character and an excellent leader. But for all of your insight into others, you don't always understand yourself. Sometimes you don't even look inward. Sometimes you just sail along feeding off what other people think of you, but in 2016 you did begin to look inward. You tried to figure out what makes YOU tick. You tried to discover what you want out of life, and how to get what you want. You are making good progress and you are evolving. With your enhanced insight, you will be in the perfect position to take advantage of the many chances that come to you in 2017. You will more easily recognize those opportunities that are best for you, and you will also understand why. That means you will be better able to hone your approach to getting what you want out of life. In the starting months of 2017, you may start to feel that you won the jackpot when it comes to your diverse goals because there will be numerous opportunities to reach for what you want. You will have to prioritize and choose those that mean the most to you, because trying to do too many things at once will only dilute your power. Stay focused on what is most important to you, and you will be able to triumph over the most important things to you, which in turn will help you feel like a winner all year through.</p><div>

<div class="love"><p>Pisces, you are wistful, sensitive, kind, intuitive, and dreamy. Not everyone gets you because you are truly a fish of a different color. Your creative nature sometimes defies logic, but somehow you can make progress with even the wildest of ideas. You may have struggled last year with certain responsibilities in your life. It isn't that you are irresponsible; you are truly moral and reliable in terms of your character. Sometimes, though, you become so distracted and scattered that you don't fulfill all of our obligations and you occasionally find yourself floundering. As the year came to an end, however, you began to see a light at the bottom of a long path, and you have been headed in the right direction in an effort to improve yourself and your life. You are doing well, Pisces. You bring with you into 2017 a new sense of yourself, a new determination to do better, and an extremely creative nature. The possibilities for you this year are endless, as long as you stick to your new way of doing things and you don't give up. Above all, you have to be true to yourself, to your vision for your life, and to making your dreams come true. Be brave in 2017, and work on building up your confidence. With proper confidence, you can do anything you set your mind to this year.</p></font>

<div class="love">
The amazing Ram is strong, sure-footed, hard-headed, and up to any challenge it comes up against. But the Ram can also be playful, lighthearted, and a bit mischievous. In 2016 you had to use those first few qualities much of the time as you may have struggled at times to survive a challenging year. In the year ahead, however, you will be able to integrate some of your more charming, fun-loving elements for a year that will give a lot more back to you. You have invested a lot in your development through learning and evolving, and the efforts of your labor and investment will be paying dividends all year long.<br><br>

<center><h1><b><font style="font-size: 30px">April 20 - May 20</b></h1></center><br>

<div class="love"><p>You are strong, tough, and determined. The Bull, the symbol of your sign, is a perfect reminder of how powerful you are. You are so powerful, in fact, that it can be hard for you to ever rest or take a break. Others turn to you, and you always accept your responsibilities and obligations graciously. During 2016 you may have struggled with this. When friends and loved ones turn to you, you can't help but say yes. And then it is often you alone who fulfills what they need. Last year was also an important turning point for you though, Taurus. Hopefully, you learned to be a little less independent, and you opened yourself up to accepting help more often from others. This is a critical lesson for you, because if you continue to be so independent, it will eventually weigh you down. You may have come a long way, but there is probably still a long way for you to go. You need to be unafraid of asking others for assistance when you need it. This will help you to bond better with others, and will also take a lot of weight off your shoulders. You have been getting better at drawing a line when others ask too much of you, and you need to continue growing stronger in that area as well. The year ahead will offer you many chances to practice this, Taurus, because others will still be turning to you way too often out of habit. Perhaps the biggest focus for you in 2017 - especially in the first few months - will be your career and making money. You will be very driven toward creating a strong foundation and a prosperous future for yourself and your loved ones. You will find many opportunities that could lead you to greater security, Taurus, but you will have to be judicious in your choices. Your innate common sense will guide you well.</p></font>

<div class="love"><p>People who don't understand you may see you as having diverse personalities because you are a person of many moods and because you always seem to be going in many different directions. Actually, Gemini, you have many facets to your one big personality, and your broad focus allows you to understand all the nuances of any situation. You can talk easily to people from all walks of life, and you can understand and empathize with them. This means that you have all kinds of friends, and that you have a wide range of dissimilar interests. You have hopefully experienced a wealth of good experiences over the last year, Gemini, and you may chalk it up to good luck. But in reality, you earned every one of your blessings through discipline, hard work, and of course your empathy and kindness. You are someone who sticks by the friends who stick by you, and you should have a strong foundation of friendship in your life. If you don't have it, the year ahead will be an excellent time to expand your network of friends. A spiritual quest you may have begun last year will carry into this year, and you will learn quite a lot about yourself in the process. Any success you enjoyed in the past, and the success you will surely enjoy in the year ahead, will be magnified by a greater sense of self than you have ever had before.</p></font>

<center><h1><b><font style="font-size: 30px">June 21 - July 22</b></h1></center><br>

<div class="love"><p>You may have started out in 2016 with a melancholy outlook and a desire for solitude. You may have kept your distance from emotional situations because you just didn't want to deal with any sticky situations. Perhaps you closed yourself off from some of your usual social activity because you were feeling more introspective. Gradually, however, you began to come alive again, though slowly at first. Your life has gotten better and more serene, and it continues to become more beautiful every day, despite some remnants of sadder moments in the past that arise in your memory from time to time. These remnants can dissipate if you give yourself a chance, and you will have plenty of opportunities in 2017 to open up your heart and begin to feel more like your old self. In fact, there will be many positive changes in your life in the year ahead - and in many areas of your life. The symbol of your sign is the Crab, and just like the crab, you protect yourself with a tough outer shell, you also move sideways in a sense; not always revealing your deepest feelings because you don't want to get hurt. Your sensitive nature has been both a blessing and a curse, but in 2017 you will come to see it as nothing but a wonderful blessing. You will feel deeply and you will have much to feel good about. Trust in the universe to write you a happily-ever-after kind of tale in 2017.</p></font>

<div class="love"><p>When you are at your best, Leo, you are strong, courageous, and sure of yourself. You exemplify the very best qualities of the majestic Lion - the symbol of your sign. You have been through a challenging few years, Leo. Some significant changes happened in your life during that time, and it impacted the way you see the world around you, and the way you see yourself. You came back more into your own in 2016, but you aren't all the way there yet. There is a lot to adjust to, Leo, but you are doing just fine. You should be in the process of regaining your balance and centering yourself. You have hopefully rebuilt your confidence and reframed your optimistic outlook on people and on life in general. As more beautiful adventures open up to you in 2017, you will complete a cycle that has taught you a lot about yourself. You will have a new way of looking at everything, and that means many new beginnings for you. In many areas of your life, big opportunities will give you chances to shine in ways you never have before - including in areas that draw on your deep well of creativity. Making discoveries through exploration that lies outside of your comfort zone will become easier for you, and using your creativity to evolve even further will be very rewarding. This will be a landmark year for you in so many ways, Leo.</p></font>

<font style="font-size: 30px;"><div class="love"><p>You began coming into your own last year. You learned a lot about yourself, and you tested the edges of new boundaries. But in typical Virgo style, you are moving slowly through your evolution. That certainly isn't a bad thing because it gives you the chance to absorb what you see and experience and to live with it for a while before you move on to the next step. In 2017, you will make many more exciting discoveries about yourself, your talents and abilities - including the ability to have your voice stand out from everyone else's. That may be a completely new experience for you, Virgo. Even though you have always had your very own unique voice, you don't always speak up and express yourself. You would rather be discovered than chase attention - but attention and opportunity do not often come knocking at one's door. There will be many chances this year to show off your newfound sense of self, but one of the best and biggest breakthroughs could happen in September, when you will be able to present something you designed and created, and which has the potential to have a significant impact on your life in the future. Continue to strive to sculpt out your highest self, and the more you define who you are, the more you will enjoy being you.</p></font>

<div class="love"><p>Your sign is represented by scales. It must get awful tiresome carrying around those scales and feeling compelled to weigh and measure everything. Being fair and upholding justice are noble principles, but it can be hard to be so perfect in daily life. You may have carried a big burden in this regard throughout 2016, Libra, but the time is coming when you will finally be able to put that burden down. Many people in your life have turned to you over the last year to mediate, to help them make important decisions, and to figure out what is fair and what is not. You have also had your own share of personal issues to deal with. You have been the steady voice of reason, but, unsurprisingly enough, it has taken a toll on you. This year, even from the very beginning, you will feel lighter and freer. There won't be as many requests for your judgment and your time, and you will begin to get a taste of what it's like to feel carefree. Even so, Libra, you may have to recognize that you have always given too much of yourself over to others, and you know this is something that has to change. You will have chances to put this new philosophy into practice, and you will be rewarded with more time to pour into your most important goals. Stand strong on your new way of dealing with this issue in the year ahead, and you'll become more of an advocate for yourself in time.</p></font>

<div class="love"><p>You have been a little less secretive and private over the last year, Scorpio, and tried to be more open to those who hoped to know you better. In return, you got to know certain people in your life on a deeper level too. You may have found that experience to be surprisingly rewarding, and it had also probably changed you in some ways. This broadened awareness of connecting more spiritually with others will be used to great advantage by you in 2017. This means that you will have closer relationships that will bring a new level of joy into your life. It also means that you will meet people you might not ordinarily want to get to know because you have a heightened sense of insight into others now. This year could bring a lot of exciting changes, Scorpio, and many of these changes will involve dreams and desires you have held dear for many years. At first, you may have a lot of old business to deal with, but once you are free of old obligations you will embark on a new chapter of your life that will be filled with opportunity. As early as February, you could meet someone you have admired intellectually, and that person could offer you entrée into some sort of an investment that has huge possibilities for you. You will surely want to say yes but don't do so haphazardly just because you trust this person so much. Even though this proposition is probably a good one, you still need to make sure you do your own research.</p></font>

<div class="love"><p>What are you aiming for this year, Archer? Whatever it is, you stand an excellent chance of getting it! That's because you paid your dues and accepted the lessons that were offered to you over the last year. You are a new person - you are your very best self. That doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't still lessons to learn and dues to pay; because learning is a lifelong experience. But you are in the perfect place right now to make major strides toward the things you want most out of life. And luckily this year, you will have the right opportunities to put your dreams into action. It is the perfect storm of having the experience, the talent, and the opportunity all at the same time. That means that your words are magic, your touch is golden, and you have the power to heal yourself and reinvent yourself. You may have begun to discover your purpose here on earth - or at least one of your main purposes for being here - and you have started to explore that. In 2017 there will be chances to really immerse yourself deeply in whatever you find yourself compelled to do, and you need to accept every opportunity you can to fulfill your destiny. This is bound to be a really fabulous year for you if you love yourself, take care of yourself, and are being persistent in pursuing your dreams.</p></font>

<center><h1><b><font style="font-size: 30px">December 22 - January 19</b></h1></center><br>

<<div class="love"><p>In most aspects of our life, Capricorn, you are an inventor and an entrepreneur. You see everything you do - not just exciting opportunities, but even the most mundane of daily tasks - as a chance to refine and perfect. This tendency can get tiresome for some people. But for you, this is the framework of your life and it gives you comfort. In many ways, this extreme attention to detail makes you feel secure because you can control any situation for a fairly predictable outcome. In the past, others may have been a bit frustrated by your attention to detail, but in 2016, it became a sense of comfort for some of the people in your life. That's because you were a guiding light and a steady force of hope for certain individuals, and they have come to see you in a new light because of it. This validates your way of doing things, and it has also opened the door to greater self-acceptance. In 2017, you are at the top of your game in every way. You may have gotten involved in many opportunities last year, but they were slow-moving and, at times, frustrating for you. While you are fine with steady progress, there were probably more disappointments and delays than you would have expected. This year, by contrast, you will find things moving far more quickly. Ventures you began last year will begin to take off, starting in February. Once you get off the ground, you will sail far and high pretty quickly. You can look forward to a splendid year with a variety of successes.</p></font>
